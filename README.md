📊 Pandas Data Analysis Project
This project demonstrates various functionalities of the Pandas library in Python through a Jupyter Notebook. It covers data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis techniques using Pandas, along with data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🏗️ Project Structure
Jupyter Notebook: The main notebook (pandas.ipynb) contains all the code and analysis.

Data: The dataset used for analysis is included in the repository.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Core Libraries
Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

Environment
Python: The programming language used for the project.

Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for running the analysis.

📦 Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Install them using:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

⚙️ Configuration
Jupyter Notebook: The notebook is pre-configured to work with the included dataset.

Dataset: The dataset is loaded directly into the notebook for analysis.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandas-data-analysis.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd pandas-data-analysis

Install the dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook pandas.ipynb

🚀 Features
Data Cleaning
Value Replacement: Replacing values in the DataFrame (e.g., replacing 'harry' with 'daniel' in the 'last name' column).

Data Analysis
Data Type Checking: Checking the data type of columns (e.g., checking the type of the 'email' column).

Data Manipulation
Various Techniques: Applying various data manipulation techniques using Pandas.

Data Visualization
Plotting: Creating plots and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
